# Simulating Hybridisation of Two Genetically Diverged Populations Under Natural Selection
A computer program in Python was written to simulate the hybridisation between two populations under natural selection. This program incorporates the concept of fitness epistasis, which is the interaction between fitness effects of different genetic loci. Simulations with varied population size, selection strength, fitness epistasis and D/n (genetic loci number to phenotypic trait number) ratio was run to investigate their effect on the fitness outcome of hybridisation.
